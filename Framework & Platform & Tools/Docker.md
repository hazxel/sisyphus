### Docker Regisry

The Registry is a stateless, highly scalable **server side application** that stores and lets you distribute Docker images. 

For example, this command starts a container which works as a registry: `docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2`

### Terminology

- **container**: is a sandboxed process on your machine that is isolated from all other processes on the host machine.
- **container image**: provides a cuntomized filesystem for container (all dependencies, configuration, scripts, binaries, environment variables, etc.)
